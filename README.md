# An Opinionated Functional Programming Course

**The course is under construction.**

I push the content of the course to GitHub chapter by chapter so that I can receive feedback as soon as possibe. Once a
chapter has been pushed to GitHub, I try not to make major changes any more. Nevertheless some refactorings may happen
because of progressive insight, consistent natural language usage, consistent `Scala` language usage other reasons.

For those who hade already studied chapter01 -> chapter06 before September 11 2024: I have refactored the code and
documentation for reasons explained in the previous paragraph, but the essence of the code and its documentation has
not changed.
